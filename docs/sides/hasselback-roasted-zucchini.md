## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a 15×10-inch baking pan with parchment paper. If necessary, remove a thin slice from one
side of each zucchini so it sits flat. Cut each in half crosswise. On a cutting board arrange two chopsticks or wooden
spoons lengthwise on either side of zucchini. Cut zucchini crosswise into ¼-inch slices, stopping when knife reaches
chopsticks (to prevent slicing all the way through). Arrange zucchini in prepared pan.

### Step 2

In a food processor combine basil and/or parsley; capers; lemon zest; 2 cloves of the garlic, minced; the sea salt; and
black pepper. Pulse until chopped and well combined. Transfer to a medium bowl. Stir in whole wheat couscous and
nutritional yeast. Spoon mixture between slices of zucchini. Spoon any remaining filling over or around zucchini. Roast,
uncovered, 25 minutes or until lightly browned and tender.

### Step 3

For Tahini Sauce, in a small food processor combine tahini, lemon juice, and remaining garlic. Process until smooth,
gradually adding 2 to 4 tablespoons of water until drizzling consistency.

### Step 4

Serve zucchini drizzled with Tahini Sauce.
