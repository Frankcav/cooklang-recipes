### Step 1

For creamier mashed potatoes, peel your Yukon gold potatoes at this time. Otherwise, just halve your potatoes and place
in a large saucepan or pot and cover with water by 1 inch.

Bring to a light boil over high heat and add 1 tsp of sea salt (as original recipe is written, adjust if altering batch
size), and cook for 25 to 30 minutes or until very tender. They should effortlessly slide off a knife when pierced with
a knife.

### Step 3

While the potatoes are cooking, chop up your chives (optional) and measure your vegan butter.

Once tender, drain your potatoes and place them back in the hot pot off the heat for 1 minute to evaporate any
additional water.

Mash your potatoes using a potato masher until fluffy.
