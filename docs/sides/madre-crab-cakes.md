## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Make the crab cakes: In a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the corn, minced onion, and
red bell pepper and cook until just tender, 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse to form a
coarse puree.

### Step 2

In a large bowl, add the corn mixture, shredded hearts of palm, panko breadcrumbs, vegan mayonnaise, crushed nori,
parsley, Old Bay seasoning, mustard powder, salt, and pepper. Stir gently to combine.

### Step 3

On a large plate, place a generous layer of breadcrumbs. Line another plate or baking sheet with parchment. Using a
4-cup measure, scoop out portions of the crab cake mixture, flatten slightly with your hands, and dredge in the
breadcrumbs. Place on the parchment-lined plate and repeat with the remaining mixture.

### Step 4

In a large, deep nonstick or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, add a thin layer of oil. When the oil is shimmering,
working in batches if needed, fry the crab cakes until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and repeat
with the remaining crab cakes.

### Step 5

Serve: Top each crab cake with a tablespoon or two of the Spicy Vegan Mayo and sprinkle the cilantro on top. Serve with
the lemon wedges.
