## :salt: Ingredients

- :leafy_green: 4 cups Brussels sprouts
- :oil_drum: some canola oil
- :salt: some salt
- :herb: 1 [cilantro almond pesto][2]
- :lemon: 1 lemon

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large pot
- 1 large bowl
- 1 skimmer or slotted spoon
- 1 kitchen towel or a few layers of paper towels
- 1 Dutch oven
- 1 baking sheet
- 1 skimmer or slotted spoon

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. While the water heats, prepare an ice bath
in a large bowl nearby. Add the trimmed and halved Brussels sprouts to the water and blanch until just tender, about 3
minutes. Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, remove the Brussels sprouts and place immediately in the ice bath Let sit for
3 minutes and drain.

### Step 2

Spread a clean kitchen towel or a few layers of paper towels across a board or counter. Spread out the blanched Brussels
sprouts on the towel and pat to dry as much as possible. (Removing most of the water now means less oil will sputter up
while frying.)

### Step 3

In a Dutch oven, heavy-bottomed pot, or high-sided frying pan over high heat, heat about 3 inches of canola oil to
350Â°F. While the oil heats, line a baking sheet with paper towels for draining and place it nearby. Working in batches
so as not to crowd the pot, fry the Brussels sprouts until lightly crispy, for about 3 minutes, flipping occasionally to
fry evenly Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, remove the fried Brussels sprouts and place on the baking sheet. Season
immediately with salt. Repeat to fry the remaining Brussels sprouts.

### Step 4

In a large bowl, toss the Brussels sprouts with the [cilantro almond pesto][2]. Transfer to a plate and serve with the
lemon wedges.
