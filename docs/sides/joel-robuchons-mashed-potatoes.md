## :salt: Ingredients

- :potato: 1 kg rattes or BF 15 potatoes
- :salt: 1 Tbsp coarse salt
- :butter: 250 g well-chilled unsalted butter
- :glass_of_milk: 250 g very hot whole milk
- :salt: some salt
- :salt: some pepper

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 saucepan
- 1 potato ricer
- 1 large saucepan
- 1 small saucepan
- 1 very fine sieve

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Put the rattes or BF 15 potatoes in a saucepan with 2 liters of cold water and 1 tablespoon of coarse salt. Bring to a
simmer, cover, and cook until a knife slips in the potatoes easily and cleanly, about 25 minutes.

### Step 2

Drain the potatoes and peel them. Put them through a potato ricer (or a food mill fitted with its finest disk) into a
large saucepan. Turn the heat to medium and dry the potato flesh out a bit by turning it vigorously with a spatula for
about 5 minutes.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, rinse a small saucepan and pour out the excess water but do not wipe it dry. Add the milk and bring to a
boil.

### Step 4

Turn the heat under the potatoes to low and incorporate the well-chilled unsalted butter bit by bit, stirring it in
energetically for a smooth, creamy finish. Pour in the very hot whole milk in a thin stream, still over a low heat,
still stirring briskly. Keep stirring until all the milk is absorbed. Turn off the heat and taste for salt and pepper.

### Step 5

For an even lighter, finer pur√©e, put it through a very fine sieve before serving.
