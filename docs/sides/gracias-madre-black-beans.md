## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Soak the dried black beans overnight.

### Step 2

In a medium pot over medium-high heat, add the dried black beans, bay leaf, oregano, and just enough water to cover
(about 2 cups). Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Stirring occasionally, simmer until the beans are
very tender, about 90 minutes.

### Step 3

In a medium nonstick pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and chopped and seeded jalapeño and
cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.

### Step 4

Add the onion mixture to the pot of beans. Using an immersion blender, puree the beans until nearly smooth, keeping a
little bit of texture. (Alternatively, you can carefully ladle the beans into a blender, puree them, then return them to
the pot.) Add the salt and taste to adjust the seasoning.
