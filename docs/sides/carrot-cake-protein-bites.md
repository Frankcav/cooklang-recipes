## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Pulse the rolled oats in a food processor or high-speed blender to create a coarse, grainy flour.

### Step 2

Add soft pitted dates, finely grated carrot, unsweetened shredded coconut, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt to the processor
and mix to form a thick, sticky dough. If the mixture does not stick together, add 1 Tbsp of warm water and process
until desired consistency is reached.

### Step 3

Scoop out a portion of dough and roll between your palms to form a bit-size ball. Repeat with the remaining dough to
create approximately 20 bites.

### Step 4

Store in an airtight container and refrigerate.
