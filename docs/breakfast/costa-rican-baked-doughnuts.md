After water is combined, add creamed corn and vanilla, mixing with your hands to combine.

### Step 4

When dough forms, pinch off thumb-size pieces and roll between your hands.

  !!!note

    These are a combination of corncake, muffin, and doughnut, so you can make them into a savory meal with salsa,
    avocados, jalapeños, and hot sauce, or bring out their sweetness with a dollop of syrup and fresh fruit.
