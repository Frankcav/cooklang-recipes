## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine the large eggs, salt, and milk in a medium bowl and whisk until homogeneous and frothy, about 1 minute. Allow to rest at room tempera ture for at least 15 minutes. The eggs should darken in color significantly.

### Step 2

Melt the butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, swirling the pan as it melts to coat evenly. Rewhisk the eggs until they are foamy, then transfer to the skillet and cook, slowly scraping the bottom and sides of the pan with a silicone spatula as the eggs solidify. Then continue to cook, scraping and folding constantly, until the eggs have formed solid, moist curds and no liquid egg remains, about 2 minutes . Immediately transfer to a plate and serve.
