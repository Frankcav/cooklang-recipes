## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the Russet potatoes and onion. Transfer the mixture to a clean
dishtowel and squeeze and wring out as much of the liquid as possible.

### Step 2

Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs, all-purpose flour, salt, baking powder and pepper,
and mix until the flour is absorbed.

### Step 3

In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in about 1/4 inch of the neutral oil. Once the oil is hot (a
drop of batter placed in the pan should sizzle), use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan, cooking
in batches.

### Step 4

Use a spatula to flatten and shape the drops into discs.

### Step 5

When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, about 5 minutes, flip.

### Step 6

Cook until the second side is deeply browned, about another 5 minutes. Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined plate
to drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.
