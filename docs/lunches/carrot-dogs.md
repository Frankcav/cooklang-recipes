## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Peel the carrots, trim the ends, and cut them to the length of your whole-grain hot dog buns.

### Step 2

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the carrots and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until
tender but not mushy. Drain the carrots in a colander and put them under cold running water. This shocks them and
prevents them from getting any softer.

### Step 3

In a small bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, water, tamari, molasses, liquid smoke, garlic powder, onion
powder, and pepper. Transfer the marinade to a large zip top bag and add the cooled carrots. Toss gently to coat.
Refrigerate overnight.

### Step 4

Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

### Step 5

Remove the carrots from the marinade and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until heated
through and slightly browned.

### Step 6

Serve the carrots in the hot dog buns with your choice of toppings.
