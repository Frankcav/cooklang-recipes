## :salt: Ingredients

- 0.5 cup pine nuts
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 4 oz basil stems
- 1.5 tsp salt

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Combine pine nuts and 1 tablespoon olive oil in 8-inch skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until pine nuts
are light golden, 3 to 6 minutes. Spread pine nuts out on plate and let cool for 15 minutes.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, bring 2 quarts water to boil in medium saucepan. Remove and discard basil stems from leaves (you should have
4 cups leaves [3 ounces by weight]). Add basil leaves and 1Â½ teaspoons salt to boiling water and cook until basil is
wilted and bright green, 5 to 10 seconds. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer basil directly to salad
spinner and spin to remove excess water. Spread basil on clean dish towel to dry. (If you don't have a salad spinner,
drain basil on clean dish towel and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.)

### Step 3

Process Parmesan in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds; transfer to medium bowl. Process garlic, pine
nuts, basil, salt, and remaining oil in now-empty processor until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl as
needed. Transfer pesto to bowl with Parmesan and stir to combine. Serve

### Step 4

TO MAKE AHEAD: Place pesto in sealable 1-pint container and cover with additional 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil.
Refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 1 month.
