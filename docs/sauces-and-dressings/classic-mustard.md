### Step 1

For mild mustard, combine the water and vinegar and bring to a boil, then mix in mustard powder, sugar, and salt.

### Step 2

Using boiling hot vinegar and water will significantly reduce the nose hit from the mustard powder.

### Step 3

Use cold liquids for hotter mustard. For variations, try substituting a dry white wine or lemon juice in place of the
water.

### Step 4

Mustard seeds/powder can be any type: mild, hot, yellow, or brown. Add whole or crushed mustard seeds after completing
the basic recipe. They adsorb a lot of liquid. If extra liquid is needed, consider using vinegar first.

### Step 5

You can experiment with numerous other spices and flavors. The most popular additions are turmeric (optional) and sweet
paprika (optional).
