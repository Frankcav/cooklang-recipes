### Step 1

In a large soup pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut√©, stirring constantly,
until the onion is soft and tender, 3 to 4 minutes.

### Step 2

Add the vegetable broth, fire-roasted tomatoes, and Italian seasoning and bring to a rolling boil. Add the tortellini
and cannellini beans and cook until the tortellini are cooked through, about 2 minutes.

### Step 3

Reduce the heat to medium and add the spinach, parsley, basil, and salt and pepper to taste and stir until the spinach
is just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Squeeze the lemon juice over the soup.

### Step 4

Ladle into bowls, sprinkle with the Parmesan, and serve immediately with torn French bread for dipping.

### Step 5

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months. Let the soup
thaw before reheating.
