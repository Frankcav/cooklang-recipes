## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Beans: Soak white beans overnight. Place the soaked, drained beans in a large saucepan and cover with 4 inches of water.
Add the bay leaf and 2 cloves of garlic, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium to maintain a
simmer, cover the pot partially, and simmer the beans until nearly tender; this can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes
depending on the size and dryness of the beans. Add the salt and continue cooking until the beans are very tender but
still holding a shape. Let cool in their liquid until needed. The beans can be stored, refrigerated airtight, for up to
1 week. When ready to use, drain well and remove the bay leaf.

### Step 2

Tomato sauce: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 400ºF. Have a ceramic or glass baking
vessel at the ready; I use an oval gratin dish measuring 9x13 inches; a 10-inch round pan or 9-inch square would work,
or anything equivalent.

### Step 3

In a wide, non-reactive skillet (steel or enamel so as not to affect the flavor of the tomatoes), heat the olive oil
over medium heat. Add the yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 10 minutes.
Add the diced tomatoes and their juices, chopped oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and
simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and saucy, 10 minutes.

### Step 4

Scrape the sauce into the pan and add the drained beans, tossing them to coat. Dot with the feta, pressing it into the
sauce, and drizzle with a bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Bake the beans until bubbling and beginning to brown on
top, 25 to 35 minutes.

### Step 5

Parsley oil: While the beans bake, place the parsley, lemon zest and lemon juice, olive oil, and salt in a blender or
small food processor. Puree smooth. The parsley oil can be kept refrigerated airtight for up to several days.

### Step 6

When the beans are baked, drizzle with some of the parsley oil and serve. Leftovers reheat well in a 350ºF oven for 10
or so minutes.
