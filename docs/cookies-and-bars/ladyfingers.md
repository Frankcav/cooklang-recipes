## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) then line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper, set aside.

### Step 2

Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and the whites in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.

### Step 3

Using a large whisk or hand mixer, whip the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of the sugar, until pale and fluffy, then beat in the
vanilla. Set aside.

### Step 4

Whip the egg whites on medium-high speed, until fluffy. Once light and fluffy add the other 1/4 cup of the sugar in a
slow and steady stream while whipping. Continue to whip until the whites hold stiff peaks.

### Step 5

Using a large metal spoon, gently fold in the whipped whites, taking care not to deflate all of the air you have
incorporated.

### Step 6

Once the egg white mixture and yolk mixture are almost combined sift the all-purpose flour, and a pinch of salt if
liked, over the batter.

### Step 7

Continue to gently fold until all of the flour is incorporated.

### Step 8

Fill a large piping bag with the batter and pipe the batter in 3.5 inch long lines about 1 inch apart.

### Step 9

Bake for 14 to 15 minutes, or until just beginning to turn golden around the edges.

### Step 10

Allow cooling fully before storing in an airtight container. The ladyfinger will keep 3 days in an airtight container.
They can also be frozen for up to 8 weeks.
