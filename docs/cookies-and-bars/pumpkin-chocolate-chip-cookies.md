## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.

### Step 2

In a mixing bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves and
salt for 20 seconds, set aside.

### Step 3

In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, blend together granulated sugar, light brown
sugar and vegetable oil until combined.

### Step 4

Mix in egg and vanilla then blend in pumpkin purée.

### Step 5

With mixer on low speed, slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until nearly combined, scraping down the sides of the
bowl as needed (batter will be pretty wet).

### Step 6

With a rubber spatula, fold in mini semisweet chocolate chips while folding batter to evenly combined.

### Step 7

Drop dough 2 Tbsp (40 g) (either using a medium cookie dough scoop or using two spoons) at a time onto baking sheets
lined with silicone liners or parchment paper, spacing cookies two inches apart.

### Step 8

Bake in preheated oven until cookies are nearly set about 11 - 13 minutes.

### Step 9

Allow to cool several minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.

### Step 10

Store in a single layer in an airtight container (these are best once they've rested in an airtight container a few
hours, they soften throughout).

!!! note

    Substitute 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the spices listed here if that's what you've got. Or feel free to
    increase spices listed, I usually like to add 2 tsp cinnamon now.
