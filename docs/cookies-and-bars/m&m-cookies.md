## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and baking soda, and set aside.

### Step 2

Cut the unsalted butter into 14 even-sized pieces. In a medium skillet, melt 10 tablespoons of butter over medium-high
heat. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until golden brown and a nutty aroma forms, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove the
skillet from heat. Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter into warm butter until completely melted.

### Step 3

In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the browned butter to the mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar,
dark brown sugar, salt, and vanilla. Whisk on medium speed (setting 5) until combined, 30 seconds.

### Step 4

Add the whole egg and egg yolk to the mixing bowl. Whisk on medium-high speed (setting 8) until smooth with no sugar
lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes.

### Step 5

Repeat the whisking and resting process 3 more times: 30 seconds mixing at medium-high speed and 3 minutes of rest.
After four total times, the mixture should be thick, smooth, and shiny.

### Step 6

Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in 3/4 cup
M&M candies and semisweet chocolate chips. Give the dough a final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain.

### Step 7

Transfer the mixing bowl to the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer for 15 minutes. Chill until the dough firms
up, around 65 to 70°F (18 to 21°C). The dough should not feel overly sticky.

### Step 8

Adjust the oven rack to the middle position. Heat to 375°F (191°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, then
set aside.

### Step 9

Divide the dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (about 60 grams, 2 ounces), and roll into a ball. If the
dough starts to warm and get sticky, place it on a sheet tray and refrigerate for 15 minutes.

### Step 10

For a rustic appearance, tear the dough balls in half, then press the two halves together again with the lumpy torn
sides facing upward to expose the chips. Shape the sides of the dough back into a circle. If desired, use the remaining
¼ cup of M&M candies and press some on top, so they pop out of the surface.

### Step 11

Arrange dough balls at least 2" apart on lined baking sheets, 8 portions per tray. Smaller baking sheets can be used but
will require baking in 3 batches. The dough should be room temperature or just below for even cooking, around 65 to
70°F (18 to 21°C).

### Step 12

Bake one tray at a time in the center position for 5 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet. Continue to bake until the
edges are golden brown and the centers look slightly underdone, about 5 to 7 minutes. The color will continue to darken
during cooling.

### Step 13

Leave the cookies on the baking sheet to cool for 3 to 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack. Make sure the oven
returns to 375°F (191°C) before baking the remaining tray.
