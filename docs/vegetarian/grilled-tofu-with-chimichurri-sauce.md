### Step 1

To prepare the rub, combine the granulated garlic, smoked paprika and cumin; mix well. Set aside.

### Step 2

Cut the extra-firm tofu in half lengthwise to make two "steaks" abut 3/4 inch thick. Brush lightly with olive oil. Press
the rub into both sides of the tofu steaks.  Just before grilling, season the tofu steak with kosher salt.

### Step 3

Place tofu directly on the cooking grate over direct heat and sear. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes.  Turn the tofu steak with a
pair of tongs and a flat spatula if necessary.

### Step 4
