## :salt: Ingredients

- :falafel: 1.25 cup chickpea bean flour
- :herb: 0.75 tsp cumin
- :salt: 0.5 tsp salt
- :droplet: 1 cup water
- :olive: 1 Tbsp olive oil
- :leafy_green: 1 cup spinach
- :herb: 2 scallions
- :sake: some greek yogurt (optional)
- :cucumber: 1 cucumber
- :mate: some za’atar (optional)

## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 medium bowl
- 1 large skillet

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

In a medium bowl, whisk together the chickpea bean flour, cumin, and salt. Whisk in the water and 1 tablespoon of the
olive oil.

### Step 2

Finely chop the spinach and thinly slice the scallions and whisk into the batter.

### Step 3

Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once it’s nice and hot, reduce the heat to medium. For each batch of
pancakes, add 2 teaspoons of oil and swirl the skillet to coat the bottom. Scoop the batter (using about 2 tablespoons
per pancake) into the skillet, spacing the pancakes 2 inches apart. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the undersides are
golden brown and the batter in the center is just about set. Flip the pancakes and cook for about 1 minute more.

### Step 4

Serve the pancakes topped with a small dollop of the greek yogurt (optional) and the sliced cucumber. Sprinkle on a
little za’atar (optional) (if using) and some more scallions.
