## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 375°F (176°C).

### Step 2

Add raw macadamia nuts or soaked blanched almonds to a food processor or blender and mix to combine, scraping down sides
as needed. You’re looking for a fine meal.

### Step 3

Add remaining ingredients: Nutritional yeast, fresh basil, oregano, lemon juice, olive oil (optional), salt, pepper,
water, and [vegan Parmesan cheese][1] (optional). You are looking for a well-puréed mixture/paste.

### Step 4

Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper for flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, and
lemon juice for brightness.

### Step 5

Pour about 1 cup (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) marinara sauce into a
9×13-inch (or similar size) baking dish and line with thinly sliced zucchini.

### Step 6

Scoop small spoonfuls amounts of ricotta mixture over the zucchini and gently spread into a thin layer. Spread on a
layer of [marinara sauce][2] and then top with more zucchini slices. Continue until all filling and zucchini are used
up. The top two layers should be zucchini and then sauce. Sprinkle on [vegan Parmesan cheese][1] (optional), and then
cover with foil.

### Step 7

Bake covered for 45 minutes, then remove foil and bake for 15 minutes more. The zucchini should be very easily pierced
when cut with a knife. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.

### Step 8

Serve immediately with additional [vegan Parmesan cheese][1] and fresh basil. Leftovers keep for 2 to 3 days in the
refrigerator, or in the freezer up to 1 month.
