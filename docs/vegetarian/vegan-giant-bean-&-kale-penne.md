## :salt: Ingredients

- 1 pkg TJ's Mini Pearl Grape Tomatoes
- 4 Tbsp olive oil
- some salt
- some pepper
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1 bag TJ's kale
- 1 pkg TJ's Penne Rigate

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Fill a large pot with water, salt it, and bring it to a boil.

### Step 2

Rinse TJ's Mini Pearl Grape Tomatoes, then dump in a medium-sized bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons or more of olive oil
and toss to coat. Add salt & pepper, then spread out on a baking tray, and roast in the oven at 400°F for about 20
minutes.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, peel and mince 4-5 large garlic cloves. Remove larger stems from TJ's kale leaves. In a large Dutch oven,
sauté garlic and kale over medium heat, until kale starts to wilt. Cover pan and turn heat to low.

### Step 4

Once the water boils, add your TJ's Penne Rigate pasta and give it a stir. Cook 6 to 8 minutes or until al dente.

### Step 5

Add roasted tomatoes (and any juices) to the garlic and kale. Then add one can of TJ's Giant Baked Beans in Tomato
Sauce. Gently stir to incorporate. Add salt & pepper to taste.

### Step 6

When the pasta is done, drain it, and add one-half to three-quarters of the penne to the garlic, kale, and tomatoes,
then mix and serve topped with grated Parmesan (optional) cheese.
