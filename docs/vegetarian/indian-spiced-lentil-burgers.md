## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Fill a medium saucepan with water 2 inches from the top. Place over medium-high heat and let come to a boil.

### Step 2

Put the brown or green lentils in a strainer and rinse under cold running water. Add the lentils to the boiling water.
Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 25 to 35 minutes, until tender (or according to package directions). Drain into
the strainer and pass under cold running water to cool. Squeeze out excess water.

### Step 3

Put the lentils in a food processor and pulse until just about smooth.

### Step 4

Drain the chickpeas in a strainer and rinse. Add them to the lentils. Pulse a few times until the chickpeas are roughly
chopped, not smooth. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl.

### Step 5

Thinly slice the white and light green parts of scallions and chop the cilantro or flat-leaf parsley; add to the lentil
mixture. Grate in 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. Add the garam masala, cumin, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir
well to combine.

### Step 6

Shape the mixture into four large or eight small 1/4 inch thick patties.

### Step 7

In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the patties and cook for 4
to 6 minutes, until a nice brown crust forms on the undersides. Carefully flip and cook 4 to 5 minutes more, adding the
remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet.

### Step 8

Serve the burgers over shredded romaine and carrots. Top the burger with cucumber slices, hot sauce, and extra cilantro.
Cut the lemon into wedges and serve with the burgers.
