## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil, shallot, and garlic. Saut√© for 2 to 3 minutes,
stirring frequently, until slightly softened and fragrant. Turn down heat if browning.

### Step 2

Add carrots and a pinch of salt and stir. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes more, then add marinara sauce and stir to coat.

### Step 3

Add red pepper flake, basil, oregano, coconut sugar, water, and red lentils. Increase heat slightly and bring mixture to
a simmer, then reduce heat to low/medium-low, cover, and continue cooking until lentils are tender - stirring
occasionally - about 17 to 20 minutes. Add a bit more water if mixture gets too thick.

### Step 4

Once lentils are cooked, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt to taste, coconut sugar for sweetness,
red pepper flake for heat, or herbs for flavor balance.

### Step 5

While the sauce is cooking, spiralize your zucchini into noodles using a tool such as this or this. Alternatively, you
can use a mandolin or vegetable peeler, or simply cook up your favorite pasta.

### Step 6

Serve the pasta over noodles of choice (I opted for raw zucchini noodles - so good!) and garnish with desired toppings -
I prefer Vegan Parmesan Cheese (optional) and red pepper flake.

### Step 7

Sauce will keep in the refrigerator up to 3 days or in the freezer 1 month.
