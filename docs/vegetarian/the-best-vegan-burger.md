## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Drain the chickpeas and sweetcorn, then tip into a food processor. Pick the coriander leaves, adding half the leaves and
all the stalks to the processor.

### Step 2

Add paprika, cumin, flour and a pinch of sea salt, finely grate in the lemon zest, then pulse until combined, but not
smooth â€“ you want to retain a bit of texture.

### Step 3

On a flour-dusted surface, divide and shape the mixture into 4 equal-sized patties, roughly 2cm thick. Place in the
fridge for 30 minutes to firm up.

### Step 4

Heat a splash of rapeseed oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the patties and cook for 10 minutes, or until
golden and cooked through, turning halfway.

### Step 5

Meanwhile, click off, wash and spin-dry four nice lettuce leaves, then finely slice the tomatoes horizontally.

### Step 6

Squeeze a large dollop of ketchup onto the base of each bun (toast them if you like), then top with the burgers. Layer
over a couple of slices of tomato, a lettuce leaf, a few coriander leaves and finally the burger buns. Delicious served
with a fresh green salad.
