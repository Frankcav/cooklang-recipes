- 2 lbs russet potatoes
- 0.5 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 0.33 cup onion
- some salt
- 1.25 cups vegetable oil
- some sour cream
- some applesauce

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Shred the potatoes and onion on the large holes of a box grater or with the shredding disk of a food processor. The
potato shreds may take on a red hue if left to sit out for a few minutes before cooking. This does not affect their
flavor.

### Step 2

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200°F. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven.
Line large plate with triple layer of paper towels.

### Step 3

Place half of russet potatoes in center of clean dish towel. Gather ends together and twist tightly to squeeze out as
much liquid as possible. Transfer to large bowl and repeat with remaining potatoes.

### Step 4

Stir all-purpose flour, eggs, shredded onion, and 1-1/4 teaspoons salt into potatoes until combined. Heat vegetable oil
in 12-inch skillet over medium heat to 325 degrees. Using 1/3-cup dry measuring cup, place 3 portions of potato mixture
in skillet and press into 4-inch disks with back of spoon.

### Step 5

Cook until deep golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side, carefully flipping pancakes with 2 spatulas. Transfer pancakes to
paper towel–lined plate to drain, about 15 seconds per side, then transfer to prepared wire rack in oven.

### Step 6

Repeat with remaining potato mixture in 3 batches, stirring mixture, if necessary, to recombine and adding extra oil to
skillet as needed to maintain 1/4-inch depth. Season pancakes with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, passing
sour cream and applesauce separately.
