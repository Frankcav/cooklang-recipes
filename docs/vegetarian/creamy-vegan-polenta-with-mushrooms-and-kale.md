## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Make the polenta: Bring 6 cups [vegetable broth][1] and 1 teaspoon salt to boil in a large saucepan. Gradually whisk in
the polenta, then turn the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the polenta has
thickened to your liking, 10 to 15 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the butter and nutritional yeast. Season to taste with
salt and black pepper; cover and set aside.

### Step 2

Prepare the mushrooms: While the polenta simmers, heat the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium. Add the finely
chopped yellow onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high,
and add the cremini mushrooms and rosemary to the skillet. Cook, tossing occasionally and adding a splash of olive oil
if the pan looks dry, until the mushrooms have released their water and are tender, 4 to 6 minutes.

### Step 3

Add the garlic and red-pepper flakes, and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant. (Be careful not to let the garlic burn.)
Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring to incorporate, until it turns a rusty brown color and begins to caramelize on
the bottom of the pan.

### Step 4

Add the red wine and cook, stirring and scraping brown bits from the pan, until the liquid is reduced by about half.

### Step 5

Add the 1 cup vegetable broth, and bring to a simmer. Begin adding handfuls of curly kale, cooking and stirring until
the kale wilts. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid in the
pan reduces and thickens, about 10 minutes.

### Step 6

Off the heat, stir in the red wine vinegar and add salt and pepper to taste. Reheat the polenta over medium low, adding
a splash of broth to loosen it if necessary. Serve the polenta and braised mushrooms and kale in shallow bowls,
sprinkled with parsley.
