- 1 bag TJ's freeze dried strawberries

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add the TJ's freeze dried strawberries to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to the consistency of a fine powder, set
aside.

### Step 2

Add whipping cream, powdered sugar, and strawberry powder to a medium bowl. Using a hand mixer or whisk, beat until
peaks form. (Be careful not to overbeatâ€”the cream will turn lumpy instead of fluffy!)

### Step 3

Spread, dollop, or swoosh whipped cream atop the TJ's Key Lime Pie to your heart's content. Serve immediately.

### Step 4

Whipped cream can be prepared a few hours ahead of time and refrigerated until needed. Cover and refrigerate leftovers
and use within a day.
