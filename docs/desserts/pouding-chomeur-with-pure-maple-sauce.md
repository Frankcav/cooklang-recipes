## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350 F.

### Step 2

Combine maple syrup, light brown sugar, heavy cream, softened unsalted butter, vanilla, and salt in a medium saucepan.
Cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Turn the heat off and
reserve.

### Step 3

In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar with an electric mixer until light,
about 5 minutes. Add the room temperature eggs and mix until fluffy, about 2 minutes.

### Step 4

In a separate bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt until very well combined. Separately,
mix the room temperature buttermilk and vanilla.

### Step 5

Add half of the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture. Mix on low speed until barely incorporated, then pour in half
the buttermilk-vanilla mixture; resume mixing on low speed until just combined. Repeat with a third of the dry
ingredients, then the buttermilk-vanilla mixture, and finally add the rest of the dry ingredients.

### Step 6

Transfer the batter to a 9-inch square baking dish. Make sure that the dish is at least 2.5 inches high, and spread
lightly to the edge.

### Step 7

Delicately pour the reserved maple sauce over the batter, placing a spoon under the stream of sauce to help break its
fall. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and completely set.

### Step 8

Remove the cake from the oven. Cool for a few hours.
