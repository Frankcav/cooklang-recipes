## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and line a baking dish with parchment paper. This recipe will make one 8x8-inch square,
one 9-inch circle, or two 6-inch rounds (adjust if altering batch size).

### Step 2

To a large mixing bowl, add strawberry purée, avocado oil, sugar, and vanilla. Whisk to combine.

### Step 3

Add almond flour, potato starch, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt to the wet ingredients and mix until fully
incorporated with no lumps remaining. The texture should be thick, like cornbread batter.

### Step 4

Pour the batter into your prepared baking dish, spread into an even layer, and bake on the center rack for 25 to 30
minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The center of the cake should be firm but springy
when touched and the edges slightly golden brown.

### Step 5

Let your cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before carefully turning it out onto a cooling rack.

### Step 6

Once your cake is completely cool, you can top it with vegan strawberry frosting, vanilla frosting, or a chocolate
ganache!

### Step 7

Best enjoyed the first day but will last, covered, at room temperature up to 3 days. Freeze up to 1 month (then thaw at
room temperature).
