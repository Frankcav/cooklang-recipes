### Step 1

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350Â°F. Line two 18x13-in rimmed baking sheets with parchment
paper. Whisk all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl.

### Step 2

In large bowl, whisk dark brown sugar, creamy peanut butter, eggs, melted unsalted butter, honey, and vanilla until
smooth. Add flour mixture and stir with rubber spatula until soft, homogeneous dough forms. Stir in chopped fine
dry-roasted peanuts until evenly distributed.

### Step 3

Working with 2 Tbsps dough at a time (or using number 30 portion scoop), roll dough into balls and evenly space on
prepared sheets (12 dough balls per sheet). Using your fingers, gently flatten dough balls until 2 inches in diameter.

### Step 4

Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are just set and just beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating after
6 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes. Using wide metal spatula, transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool
completely before serving.
