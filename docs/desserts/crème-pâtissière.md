### Step 1

Pour the whole milk and double cream into a pan. Add the vanilla paste and bring just to the boil, then take off the
heat.

### Step 2

Whisk the egg yolks, caster sugar and cornflour together in a bowl. Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture whisking
continuously. Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously until the cream thickens.
Cook over a low heat for 2 - 3 minutes to cook out the flour.

out onto a shallow tray and cover the surface with cling film. Leave to cool then chill in the fridge until set.
