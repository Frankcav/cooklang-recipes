## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 425F and gather ingredients & cut veggies.

### Step 2

BAKE SWEET POTATOES: Dice the sweet potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes and place on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Toss with a
little olive oil, and a generous five-finger pinch of salt and pepper. Spread out and bake in the middle of the oven
until crispy and tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

### Step 3

COOK QUINOA: At the same time, bring dry quinoa, water, and pinch of salt to boil in a medium pot. Once boiling, cover,
turn heat to low and cook until all the water is gone about 15 minutes. Turn heat off and leave covered. Fluff before
serving.

### Step 4

SAUTE FILLING: Also at the same time, in a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sauté diced onions 2 to
3 minutes until they just begin to soften. Add garlic, corn, poblano chili, and red bell pepper and lower heat to med,
sautéing until tender, about 10 minutes. Season with the salt, cumin, coriander, and oregano. Set aside. When the sweet
potatoes are tender, add them to these veggies.

### Step 5

WHIP THE BLACK BEANS: Place 1 can refried black beans into a medium pot, breaking them up with a fork. Add 1/4 cup water
(or more) to loosen. Gently warm over medium-low heat, whipping with a fork until they are smooth and creamy. Add a
drizzle of olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, chili powder, and cumin. If you don’t care about it being vegan, stir in grated
melty cheese (optional) or a dollop of sour cream for extra richness. Whip with fork until creamy and flavorful. You
want these to be slightly salty. Cover and turn heat off.

### Step 6

Peruvian BURRITO BOWLS: Spoon some warm whipped black beans into the bottom of a bowl. Top with some quinoa, vegges and
AJI VERDE Sauce. Garnish with avocado slices, diced tomatoes, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, sunflower sprouts. If making
bowls instead of burritos, I would double the beans for 4-6 people.
