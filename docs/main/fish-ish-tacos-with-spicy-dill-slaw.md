## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Air-fry or bake TJ's Battered Plant-Based Fish Fillets according to package directions.

### Step 2

While fillets are baking, in a small bowl, whisk  TJ's Vegan Creamy Dill Dressing and TJ's Hot & Sweet Jalapeño brine
to emulsify. Add chopped jalapeños. Add ¼ cup of prepared dressing to a large bowl with ready TJ's Ready Veggies OR
Organic Shredded Green & Red Cabbage with Orange Carrots and toss to combine (reserve remaining dressing for taco
assembly). Refrigerate until ready to serve.

### Step 3

Turn a burner on medium heat. Using tongs, warm corn tortillas directly over flame for a couple of minutes, turning over
every 30 seconds or so, until warmed through and just barely charred on the edges.

### Step 4

Slice cooked fillets in half lengthwise. To assemble tacos, place one fillet half on a warm tortilla, top with slaw,
feta cheese, cilantro, and more dressing if desired. Serve with lime wedges on the side.
