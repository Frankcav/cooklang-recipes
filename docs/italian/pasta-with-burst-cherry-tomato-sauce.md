## :pencil: Instructions

!!! note
    Be sure to use cherry tomatoes; grape tomatoes won't break down as much and will produce a drier sauce. Our topping
    contributes crunch and depth, but you can substitute 1 cup (2 ounces) of grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. For a
    spicier dish, use the larger amount of red pepper flakes.

### Step 1

FOR THE TOPPING: Heat olive oil in 10-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add capers and rinsed, patted dry,
and minced anchovy and cook, stirring frequently, until capers have darkened and shrunk, 3 to 4 minutes. Using slotted
spoon, transfer caper mixture to paper towelâ€“lined plate; set aside. Leave oil in skillet and return skillet to medium
heat. Add panko, salt, and pepper to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until panko is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
Transfer panko to medium bowl. Stir in parsley, lemon zest, and reserved caper mixture.

### Step 2

FOR THE PASTA: Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. While water is coming to boil, heat olive oil, thinly sliced
garlic, and anchovy in large saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until anchovies break down and
garlic is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes, salt, sugar, and red pepper flakes to saucepan and stir
to combine. Cover and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, add penne rigate, orecchiette, campanelle, or other short pasta and 1 tablespoon salt to boiling water. Cook,
stirring often, until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot. Off heat, add
butter and tomato mixture to pasta and stir gently until oil, butter, and tomato juices combine to form light sauce,
about 15 seconds. Adjust consistency with reserved cooking water as needed, adding 2 tablespoons at a time. Stir in
basil and season with salt to taste. Serve, passing topping separately.
