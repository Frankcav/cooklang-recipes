## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 375°F. Slice squash halves into 1/2" half-moon-shaped pieces. Spray a large baking sheet with a light
dusting of oil and sprinkle with a little sea salt and pepper. Place the slices on the sheet in a single layer. Lightly
spray the tops and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until the slices are tender, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven
and set aside to cool; lower oven temperature to 350°F.

### Step 2

Empty Alfredo sauce into a sauce pan; warm over very low heat, just enough to liquefy, and remove from heat. Place
ricotta cheese, chopped spinach, nutmeg and a pinch of salt into a bowl and combine. Set aside.

### Step 3

Assemble lasagna: Coat the bottom of a 9"x 13" baking dish with a light layer of Alfredo sauce. Place four sheets of no
boil lasagna noodles side by side and top them with more Alfredo sauce. Next, add squash in a single layer. Top squash
with more Alfredo sauce and another layer of noodles. Top noodles with all of the ricotta-spinach mixture and smooth
out. Top with another layer of noodles, then Alfredo sauce and the last of the squash. Pour over the remainder of
Alfredo sauce and top with Mozzarella cheese & Parmesan cheeses.

### Step 4

Cover lasagna with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese is golden
and bubbly. Remove from oven and rest 15 minutes before slicing.
