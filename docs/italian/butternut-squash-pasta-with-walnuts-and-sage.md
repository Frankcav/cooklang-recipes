## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 medium skillet

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Roast the butternut squash cubes with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper for about 20
minutes, or until they're soft and mostly cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside.

### Step 2

Cook spaghetti or linguine pasta in salty water until al dente and reserve at least 1 cup of the starchy pasta water.

### Step 3

Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil and butter, then add the shallot and cook until
translucent. Add the chopped sage and cook for another 30 seconds, then add the walnuts, chickpeas, butternut squash
cubes, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until the chickpeas and squash brown a bit (but before the garlic burns).

### Step 4

Add a big squeeze of lemon and a good splash of balsamic vinegar and stir.

### Step 5

Add the cooked pasta and spinach. Use tongs to gently toss the pasta with everything in the pan, allowing the greens to
wilt. Add pasta water to help loosen it (I used about 1/4 cup).

### Step 6

Add some grated pecorino (optional) at this step if you wish.

### Step 7

Remove from heat, then stir in the chopped parsley.

### Step 8

Taste and adjust seasonings and serve with extra grated cheese.
