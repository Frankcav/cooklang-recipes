### Step 1

Cut your vanilla beans in half, then split open each half to expose the vanilla seeds on the inside of the pod.

### Step 2

Place cut vanilla beans inside your glass bottle.

### Step 3

Add vodka or bourbon, filling up to the neck of the bottle.

### Step 4

Seal tightly and store bottle in a cool, dry place.

### Step 5

Every few days, tilt your bottle upside down to gently mix the liquid inside.

### Step 6

and wait a little.)

!!! note
    As a guide you use 1 cup/8 ozs of vodka to 4 - 6 vanilla beans, depending on the quality of the beans.
