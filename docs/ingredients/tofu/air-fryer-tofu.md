- :butter: 16 oz tofu
- :takeout_box: 2 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce

- :onion: 1 tsp onion powder

- 1 air fryer

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat your air fryer to 400ºF (200ºC) (I preheat mine according to manufacturer’s recommendations, for about 3
minutes).

### Step 2

Cut the tofu into cubes. I don’t press the tofu because I prefer to save some time and also think it’s not
necessary, but it’s up to you. I just drain the tofu and discard the liquid.

### Step 3

Place the tofu cubes into a mixing bowl and add tamari or soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and olive oil. Stir
until well combined and let the tofu marinate for at least 15 minutes, preferably overnight.

### Step 4

Transfer the tofu cubes to the air fryer basket in a single layer and cook for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown,
shaking the pan a couple of times to promote even cooking. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook
half the tofu at a time.

### Step 5

Serve immediately with dishes like veggie stir fry, cabbage soup, or vegetable soup.

### Step 6

Keep the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.
