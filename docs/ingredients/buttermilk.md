## :salt: Ingredients

- 1 cup [whole milk][1]
- 1 Tbsp vinegar or lemon juice

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Mix 1 cup of whole milk with 1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice and let
it sit for 10 to 15 minutes.

!!! note
    The acidity in buttermilk tenderizes
    the gluten (protein) in flour, plus it works with
    baking soda better than plain milk by both
    neutralizing the flavor of the soda at the same
    time it is activating it, providing wonderful
    leavening.
