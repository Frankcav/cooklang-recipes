## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 425°F.

### Step 2

Put the water, unsalted butter, and salt in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Remove it from the heat
and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously. Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat, stirring all the
while, until the mixture forms a ball; this should take only about a minute. Remove the pan from the heat and let the
mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes, to 140°F. It will still feel hot, but you should be able to hold a finger in it for a
few seconds. Transfer the dough to a mixer and beat in the room temperature eggs one at a time; the mixture will become
fluffy. Beat for at least 2 minutes after adding the last egg.

### Step 3

Form the choux paste into whatever shape you desire, using a spoon, or by putting the dough in a pastry bag and piping
it.

### Step 4

Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Turn off the
oven, open the door a crack, and leave the pastry inside to cool for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool
completely. Carefully split the pastry, fill, and frost as desired.

  Sugar is optional. At the very least, choux should be seasoned with salt. If it's going to be used for a dessert, a
  small amount of sugar can also be added to gently push it in a sweet direction.
