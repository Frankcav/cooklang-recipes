### Step 1

Using the shredder attachment on a food processor, shred the cold coconut oil. Transfer the shredded oil to a bowl,
cover, and refrigerate.

### Step 2

Over a large bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.

### Step 3

Place the bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes.

### Step 4

In a food processor, add the flour mixture and coconut oil and pulse until just combined. With the processor running,
add the ice water and apple cider vinegar until a loose dough forms.

### Step 5

Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and use your hands to press the dough into a ball.

### Step 6

Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (about 3 ounces each) and roll each one into a ball.

### Step 7

Use a tortilla press or rolling pin to flatten the balls into roughly 6 inch circles.

### Step 8

Place the dough circles between layers of parchment or plastic wrap and chill until ready to use.
