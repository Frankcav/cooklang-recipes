## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Add the tofu cubes, tamari or soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper to a large bowl, mix until well
combined, and let it rest for at least 5 minutes.

### Step 2

Drain the tofu and transfer 1/3 of the tofu cubes into a freezer bag with 1 or 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and toss to coat.
Repeat this step with the remaining tofu and cornstarch. Add more cornstarch if needed.

### Step 3

If you donâ€™t want to use a freezer or plastic bag, just add the cornstarch to a shallow dish, then the tofu cubes and
toss to coat.

### Step 4

Once the tofu cubes are coated with the cornstarch, heat the 1 to 2 Tbsp of oil of choice in a skillet or a pan and add
the tofu cubes. I used extra virgin olive oil, but any oil will do.

### Step 5

Cook the tofu cubes over medium-high heat until all sides are golden brown. Remove the tofu from the skillet and place
it onto a plate or a wire rack.

### Step 6

Serve immediately with dishes like vegetable tempura, sauteed kale, vegan stuffed peppers, or even roasted red peppers.

### Step 7

Keep the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
