## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Remove the thick lower stems from the oyster mushrooms.

### Step 2

Over a large bowl, shred the oyster mushrooms into bite-size pieces. Set aside.

### Step 3

In a large cast-iron or other heavy sauté pan over medium heat, toast the dried guajillo chiles and dried ancho chile
until just fragrant, about 3 minutes.

### Step 4

In a high-speed blender, add the toasted chiles, chipotle in adobo, onion, pineapple juice, orange juice, apple cider
vinegar, garlic, clove, salt, pepper, cumin. and oregano.

### Step 5

Blend until smooth.

### Step 6

Pour the mixture over the mushrooms and toss to coat. Don't worry if the sauce doesn't look like it will coat all of the
mushrooms-they'll collapse as they marinate, and you can give them another stir halfway through.

### Step 7

Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before cooking.

### Step 8

When ready to serve, heat a large nonstick pan over medium heat.

### Step 9

Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the mushrooms and leave any excess marinade in the bowl.

### Step 10

Cook until the mushrooms are warmed through and the marinade has thickened a bit and become saucy, about 10 minutes.
