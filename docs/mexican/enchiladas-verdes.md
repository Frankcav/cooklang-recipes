## :cooking: Cookware

- 1 large pot
- 1 large nonstick or cast-iron pan
- 1 small baking dish

## :pencil: Instructions

### Step 1

Preheat the oven to 400°F.

### Step 2

Peel and quarter the potatoes.

### Step 3

In a large pot over medium-high heat, add the Russet potatoes, enough water to cover, and a generous pinch of salt.
Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly. Dice the
cooked potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces.

### Step 4

In a large nonstick or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the diced onion, garlic, and a pinch
of salt and cook until the onion is translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the potatoes, peas, jalapeño, chili powder, and
salt to taste and cook until the jalapeño has softened and the potatoes start to coat the mixture, 5 minutes more.
Taste and adjust salt if needed.

### Step 5

In a small baking dish, pour about 1/2 cup of the [salsa verde][3] and spread it around to coat the bottom. Fill each
[corn tortilla][2] with about 1/4 cup of the potato mixture, roll it up, and place it seam side down in the dish.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas, lining them up snugly in the dish. Spread the remaining salsa verde on top of the
enchiladas. Bake until the salsa bubbles and the edges of the tortillas begin to crisp slightly, about 20 minutes.

### Step 6

Garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds, a little more salsa verde, and cilantro and serve with the avocado and
[black beans][4].
