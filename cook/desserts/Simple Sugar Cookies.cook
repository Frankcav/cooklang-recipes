Preheat the oven to 350°F.

In a #large bowl{}, beat together the @vegetable shortening{1/2%cup} and @sugar{2/3%cup} until smooth. Add the @buttermilk{1/4%cup} and @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, again beating until well combined. The mixture may look a bit curdled, which is OK. Add the @nutmeg{1/8%tsp}, @flour{2%cups}, @baking soda{1/2%tsp}, and @salt{1/4%tsp} to the wet ingredients and beat until the mixture forms a cohesive dough.

Drop the dough in round balls onto a #parchment-lined baking sheet{}. They should be a bit bigger than a Ping-Pong ball, a bit smaller than a golf ball. Using a #cookie scoop{} (or a small ice cream scoop that holds about 2 level tablespoons of liquid) makes this task extremely simple. Leave about 2 between the dough balls, as they’ll spread as they bake. If you want a crisp cookie, flatten the cookies as described above. If you like a chewier center, leave them as is.

Bake the cookies for 16 to ~{18%minutes}, until they’re just beginning to brown around the bottom edges. Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack. As they cool, they’ll become crisp. If you want them to remain crisp, store them in an airtight container when they’re totally cool. If you want them to get a bit chewy, store them in a bag with a slice of apple. [- To make 4 cookies, make balls of dough about 2 in diameter. Flatten them and bake as directed above. Yield: about ten 4 cookies. -]
