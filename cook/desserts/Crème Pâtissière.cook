Pour the @whole milk{300%ml} and @double cream{200%ml} into a #pan{}. Add the @vanilla paste{1/2%tsp} and bring just to the boil, then take off the heat.

Whisk the @egg yolks{5%medium}, @caster sugar{100%g} and @cornflour{40%g} together in a bowl. Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture whisking continuously. Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously until the cream thickens. Cook over a low heat for 2 - 3 minutes to cook out the flour.

Remove from the heat and pass through a sieve into a bowl, then beat in the @softened unsalted butter{100%g} until smooth. Pour out onto a shallow tray and cover the surface with cling film. Leave to cool then chill in the fridge until set.
