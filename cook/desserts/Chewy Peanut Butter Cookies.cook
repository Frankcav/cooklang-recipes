Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350Â°F. Line two #18x13-in rimmed baking sheets{} with #parchment paper{}. Whisk @all-purpose flour{1.5%cups}, @baking soda{1%tsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp} together in #medium bowl{}.

In #large bowl{}, whisk @dark brown sugar{1.5%cups}, @creamy peanut butter{1%cup}, @eggs{2%large}, melted @unsalted butter{4%Tbsp}, @honey{2%Tbsp}, and @vanilla{1%tsp} until smooth. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat the process of resting and whisking 2 more times until the mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny. Add flour mixture and stir with #rubber spatula{} until soft, homogeneous dough forms. Stir in chopped fine @dry-roasted peanuts{1/2%cup} until evenly distributed.
