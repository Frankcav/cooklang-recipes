Microwave the @chocolate pizzelle cookies{1%pkg}, one at a time, for 45 seconds until pliable. Let them cool in a taco holder (or just hold them with your hands for 30 seconds until they set).

Fill your shells with @fudge ripple ice cream{1%container}. I found a piping bag to be easiest here.

Roll your tacos in chopped @peanuts{}.

Dip the top of your taco in melted @chocolate{}. Freeze until set.
