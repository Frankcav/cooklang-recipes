Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

In a #mixing bowl{}, cream the @butter{2%sticks}, 1 cup @sugar{1%cup}, and the @brown sugar{1%cup} until they're light and fluffy. Mix in 2 of the @eggs{2}.

In a separate bowl, combine the @all-purpose flour{2%cups}, @baking powder{1%tsp}, @baking soda{1%tsp}, @cocoa powder{1/2%cup}, and @salt{3/4%tsp}. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients to form a soft dough.
