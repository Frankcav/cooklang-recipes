Combine the @bread flour{260%g}, @baking soda{1%tsp}, @baking powder{1/4%tsp}, and @salt{1.25%tsp} in a #medium-large bowl{} and #whisk{} to fully incorporate the ingredients. Set aside.

In the bowl of a #stand mixer{}, fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the @unsalted butter{168%g}, @granulated sugar{50%g} and @light brown sugar{250%g} on medium to medium high speed until fully incorporated and lightened in color, about 3 to ~{5%minutes}, scraping the bowl, as needed.
