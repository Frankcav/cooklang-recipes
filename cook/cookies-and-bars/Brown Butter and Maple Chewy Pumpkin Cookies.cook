First, brown the @unsalted butter{220%g}. Melt 1 cup of butter over medium heat, continuing to stir until it reaches a rich amber color.

Pour the butter into a measuring glass to ensure you have the right amount, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to get all of the brown bits as well. It should be a bit short of 1 cup. Place in the refrigerator to chill for about ~{20%minutes}. Don’t let it solidify.

Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a #large baking sheet{} with #parchment paper{}.

In a #medium bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{280%g}, @baking soda{1%tsp}, @baking powder{1/2%tsp}, @salt{1/2%tsp}, @pumpkin pie spice{1.5%tsp}, and @cinnamon{1/2%tsp}. Set aside.

In a #large mixing bowl{}, whisk together the @dark brown sugar{280%g} and cooled brown butter. It should look like clumpy wet sand.

Whisk in the @egg yolk{1%large}, @maple syrup{3%Tbsp}, @vanilla{1%tsp}, and @pumpkin purée{80%g} until smooth.

Add in all of the dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to fold into the dough. If your dough feels too thin (it should hold its shape when scooped), chill the dough for about 15 to ~{20%minutes} until thickened. This can happen sometimes if the butter is too warm at the start.

Off to the side, mix together the @light brown sugar{1.5%Tbsp}, @granulated sugar{1.5%Tbsp}, and @cinnamon{0.75%tsp} in a small dish to make the coating.

Scoop out the dough in 60 g portions. Drop into the cinnamon sugar mixture and toss to coat. The dough will be very soft but not sticky.

Place onto the baking sheet, spaced about 3 inches apart from each other. You should be able to bake 4 to 5 cookies at a time. Leave the rest of the dough out at room temperature.

Bake for 12 to ~{15%minutes} (13.5 minutes for me) or until the edges are darkened and the center looks puffed and slightly underdone.

Allow them to rest on the baking sheet for a couple minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. Continue to bake the rest of the cookie dough.

Allow the cookies to cool, then dig in!
