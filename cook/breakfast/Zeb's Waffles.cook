Preheat a #waffle iron{}. Using a #grater or vegetable peeler{}, zest the @orange{1}.

In a #bowl{}, combine the @rolled oats{1%cup}, @walnuts{1/4%cup}, @flaxseed meal{2%Tbsp}, orange zest, and @cinnamon{1/4%tsp}. Place two-thirds of the mixture into a #food processor or high-speed blender{}.

Blend until the mixture has a flour-like texture. Return to the bowl with the remaining one-third of the dry ingredients; this step ensures that the waffles have a chunky texture. If you prefer a smoother, uniform texture to your waffles, blend all of the dry ingredients initially.

Add the smashed @banana{1} and @milk{1/2%cup} to the dry ingredients in the bowl. Mix thoroughly with a fork; the batter will be fairly thick. If you prefer a thinner batter, add more milk.

Portion the batter thickly onto a preheated waffle iron and spread it out to all corners. Close the lid and cook the waffle according to the manufacturerâ€™s directions for your waffle iron. When done, remove the waffle from the iron (some waffles require the assistance of a chopstick to encourage release from the waffle iron). Top with sliced @kiwi{2}, @raspberries{1/2%cup}, and @maple syrup{4%tsp}.
