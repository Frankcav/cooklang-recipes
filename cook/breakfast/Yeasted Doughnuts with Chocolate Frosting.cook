You'll need two large baking sheets and two wire racks for this recipe. You'll also need 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters. For the best results, weigh the flour for the doughnuts and the confectioners' sugar for the frosting. Heating the oil slowly will make it easier to control the temperature when frying. Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more. If the frosting stiffens before you use it, microwave it at 50 percent power, stirring every 30 seconds, until it is smooth and fluid. The frosting can be made up to 48 hours in advance.

FOR THE DOUGHNUTS: Stir @all-purpose flour{4.5%cups}, @sugar{1/2%cup}, and @instant yeast{1%tsp} together in bowl of #stand mixer{}. Add @milk{1/5%cups} and @egg{1%large} and mix with #rubber spatula{} until all ingredients are moistened. Fit stand mixer with dough hook and mix on medium-low speed until cohesive mass forms, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl if necessary. Cover bowl with #plastic wrap{} and let stand for 20 minutes.

Add @salt{1.5%tsp} and mix on medium-low speed until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 5 to 7 minutes. With mixer running, add @unsalted butter{8%Tbsp}, a few pieces at a time, and continue to mix until butter is fully incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 7 to 13 minutes longer, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing. Transfer dough to lightly greased #large bowl{}, flip dough, and form into ball. Cover bowl with #plastic{}. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Transfer to refrigerator and chill overnight (or up to 48 hours).

Adjust oven racks to lowest and middle positions. Place loaf pan on lower rack. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and grease parchment. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter. Press into 8-inch square of even thickness, expelling as much air as possible. Roll dough into 10 by 13-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Using #3-inch round cutter{} dipped in flour, cut 12 rounds. Using #1-inch round cutter{} dipped in flour, cut hole out of center of each round. Transfer doughnuts and holes to prepared #sheet{}. (If desired, use 1-inch cutter to cut small rounds from remaining dough. Transfer to sheet with doughnuts.) Bring #kettle or small saucepan{} of water to boil.

Pour 1 cup boiling water into loaf pan. Place sheet on upper rack, uncovered. Close oven and allow doughnuts to rise until dough increases in height by 50 percent and springs back very slowly when pressed with your knuckle, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

About 20 minutes before end of rising time, add @vegetable oil{2%qts} to #large Dutch oven{} until it measures about 1.5 inches deep and heat over medium-low heat to 360째F. Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Using both your hands, gently place 4 risen doughnuts in oil. Cook until golden brown on undersides, 1 to 1.5 minutes, adjusting burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature between 350째F and 365째F. Using #spider skimmer{}, flip doughnuts and cook until second sides are browned, 1 to 1.5 minutes. Transfer doughnuts to prepared rack. Return oil to 360째F and repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, transfer all to oil and stir gently and constantly until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to prepared rack to cool. Let doughnuts cool completely, about 20 minutes.

FOR THE FROSTING: While doughnuts cool, microwave finely chopped @bittersweet chocolate{4%oz} and @water{1/2%cup} in #medium bowl{} at 50 percent power until chocolate is melted, about 30 seconds. Whisk in @confectioners' sugar{2%cups}, @unsweetened cocoa powder{2%Tbsp}, and @salt{1%pinch} until smooth and fluid. Let cool slightly.

Set clean wire rack in now-empty sheet. Dip top half of 1 cooled doughnut into frosting until evenly coated, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Invert doughnut and place on wire rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. Let doughnuts stand until frosting is dry to touch, 15 to 30 minutes, before serving.
