In a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @water{1%cup}, @sweet potato puree{1/2%cup}, and @cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice{1/4%tsp}. Add the @pancake mix{1%cup} and stir just to combineâ€”the batter should be lumpy.

Place a #griddle or nonstick skillet{} over medium-high heat to let it get nice and hot. Then reduce the heat to medium. Melt a little @butter{} in the skillet then swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet.

For each pancake, spoon in 1/4 cup of batter. Cook until bubbles form on top of the pancakes and the batter is set, 2 to 3 minutes. Then use a #spatula{} to flip the pancakes and cook them until golden brown on the other side, 2 to ~{3%minutes}. Serve with warm @syrup{}.
