Mix @TJâ€™s Gluten Free Organic Rolled Oats with Ancient Grains & Seeds{1/2%cup}, @applesauce{1/4%cup}, @honey{2%Tbsp}, @salt{1/8%tsp}, @baking powder{1/4%tsp}, @cinnamon{1/4%tsp}, @egg{1}, and @berries{1%handful} in a #coffee mug{}. Stir well until thoroughly combined.

In a microwave oven, heat on high for 4 minutes*, or until mixture is no longer wet on the surface. The muffin will expand as it cooks and may partially rise out of the mug.

Carefully remove the mug from the microwave, as it will be very hot, and let cool for about 5 minutes. Top with some fresh berries (optional), drizzle with more honey if desired, and serve.
