@Butter{1/4%cup} and @olive oil{1%Tbsp} are melted in a #pan{}, then @sliced shallots{1%cup} and @garlic{2%cloves} get sautéed until they start to get a little soft. Next, you add your thinly sliced @porcini mushrooms{2%cups} and season them with a little @salt{}, @pepper{}, and @thyme{2%Tbsp}. I couldn’t get my hands on fresh porcini mushrooms so I used baby bella mushrooms instead.

While all of this is cooking on the stove, toast up two thick slices of @crusty bread{4%thick slices}. My preference is a yummy sourdough boule, but feel free to go with what you’d like! You’ll also need to whisk up some softened @mascarpone cheese{1%cup} with a bit of olive oil, @salt{}, and @pepper{}. Once your bread is crunchy, your mushrooms are flavorful, and your mascarpone is seasoned, spread the cheese onto the bread, top with the sautéed mushrooms, and sprinkle with some @thyme{2%Tbsp}, @flaky salt{}, and grated @Parmesan{2%Tbsp}.
