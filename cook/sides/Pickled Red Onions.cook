Thinly slice the @red onions{2%small} (it's helpful to use a #mandoline{}), and divide the onions between 2 #16-ounce jars{2} or 3 (10-ounce) jars. Place the @garlic{2%cloves} and @mixed peppercorns{1%tsp} in each jar, if using.

Heat the @white vinegar{2%cups}, @water{2%cups}, @cane sugar{1/3%cup}, and @sea salt{2%Tbsp} in a #medium saucepan{} over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve, about ~{1%minute}. Let cool and pour over the onions. Set aside to cool to room temperature, then store the onions in the fridge.

Your pickled onions will be ready to eat once they're bright pink and tender - about~{1%hour} for very thinly sliced onions, or overnight for thicker sliced onions. They will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
