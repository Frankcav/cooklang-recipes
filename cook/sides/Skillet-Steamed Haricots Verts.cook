We developed this recipe with beans that were about 1/4 inch wide. If your haricots verts are skinnier, decrease the water to 3 tablespoons and decrease the covered cooking time to 2 minutes.

Arrange @haricots verts{12%oz} in even layer in #12-inch skillet{}. Add @water{1/4%cup} and sprinkle evenly with @salt{1/4%tsp}. Cook over medium-high heat until water is sizzling. Cover and continue to cook until beans are bright green and crisp tender, about ~{3%minutes} longer, tossing beans twice during cooking. Reduce heat to medium. Add @unsalted butter{1%Tbsp} and minced @shallot{1%Tbsp} and continue to cook, uncovered, tossing beans frequently, until water has evaporated, about ~{1%minute} longer. Season with salt to taste, and serve.
