>> serves: 8

Add @Unexpected Cheddar{1%pkg} cheese broken up into chunks, @cream cheese{1%pkg} @chili pepper sauce{1%tsp}, @21 Seasoning Salute{1%tsp} and @lemon juice{1%tsp} to #food processor{} bowl. Pulse to bring mixture together, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Continue to process until mixture is smooth, 1 to ~{2%minutes}.

Lay a square of #cling wrap{} large enough to cover cheese ball on work surface. Scoop cheese mixture into center of wrap, then gather wrap up on all sides, gently shaping the mixture into a ball. Twist the ends of the cling wrap tightly, and refrigerate cheese ball (~{2%hours} minimum, but overnight really lets the flavors meld together!).

Before serving, remove cheese ball from fridge. Spread @chopped Sweet & Spicy pecans{1/2%pkg} on work surface. Unwrap cheese ball and press into chopped pecans, gently reshaping as needed. Serve with a cheese spreader, surrounded by @TJ's Golden Rounds Crackers{1%pkg}.
