Mash the @garbanzo beans{1%can} in a #large bowl{}. Stir in the @onion{1%small}, @garlic{2%cloves}, @cilantro{1.5%Tbsps}, @parsley{1%tsp}, @cumin{2%tsp}, @turmeric{1/8%tsp}, @baking powder{1/2%tsp}, @bread crumbs{1%cup}, @salt and @pepper. Do not be afraid to use your hands. Shape the mixture into 1-1/2 inch balls; you should get 18 to 24. If the mixture does not hold together, add a little water.

Heat the @oil in a #deep fryer{} to 375°F (190°C). Carefully drop the balls into the hot oil, and fry until brown. If you do not have a deep fryer, heat the oil in a heavy deep skillet over medium-high heat. You may need to adjust the heat slightly after the first couple of falafels, and be sure to turn frequently so they brown evenly.
