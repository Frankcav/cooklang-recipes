Even though we used 2/3 cup, we found that the type of honey didn’t affect the flavor of the cornbread much—except with very strong honey, such as buckwheat. That lent a distinctive deep, molasses-y flavor that some of our tasters didn’t like. The test kitchen’s favorite cornmeal is Anson Mills Fine Yellow Cornmeal.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375°F. Grease #8-inch square baking pan{}. Whisk @buttermilk{1%cup}, @honey{2/3%cup}, @eggs{2%large}, and melted @unsalted butter{4%Tbsp} in #bowl{} until thoroughly combined and no streaks of honey remain. Whisk @all-purpose flour{1.25%cup}, @cornmeal{1%cup}, @salt{1%tsp}, @baking powder{1%tsp}, and @baking soda{1/4%tsp} together in #large bowl{}.

Whisk buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30 to ~{35%minutes}. Let cool in pan for ~{5%minutes}. Remove cornbread from pan and let cool on wire rack for 15 to ~{20%minutes}. Serve.
