Heat the oven to 350°F. Oil an #8.5 or 9 inch loaf pan{}; line with #parchment{}, leaving a 2 inch overhang on two sides.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{285%g}, @baking powder{1%tsp}, @cinnamon{1%tsp}, @salt{0.75%tsp} and @baking soda{0.5%tsp}. In a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @vegetable oil{1/2%cup}, @pumpkin purée{1%15-oz can}, @granulated sugar{200%g}, @brown sugar{165%g}, @eggs{2%large}, @sour cream{1/4%cup} and @vanilla{1.5%tsp}. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until fully combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth into an even layer.

Bake until the loaf is puffed and set, and a skewer inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 60 to ~{75%minutes}. Transfer the bread, in the pan, to a #cooling rack{} to cool for ~{20%minutes}. Use a #paring knife{} to cut the two exposed sides of bread away from the pan, then use the parchment to transfer the cake to the rack. Let cool completely.
