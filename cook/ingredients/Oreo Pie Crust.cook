Pulse the @Oreos{24%cookies} (filling included) in a #food process{} or chopper until you get fine crumbs. Add the crumbs to a #large bowl{}. Add the melted @butter{4%Tbsp} and stir to ensure the crumbs are well coated.

Pour the mixture into a #9-inch ungreased pie plate{} and carefully press the mixture evenly on the bottom and sides of the pie plate. I like to use a 1/3 or 1/4 cup dry measuring cup to press it flat.

To set the crust, you can either bake it or refrigerate it. If I'm going to use it in a no-bake recipe, I just put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the butter to harden and set the crust. Otherwise, you can bake it in a 350Â°F oven for 8 to 10 minutes, then allow it to cool completely before finishing your recipe.
