Using a carrot #peeler{}, remove the zest of 3 @lemons{3}, being careful to avoid the white pith. Put the zest in a #food processor{} fitted with the steel blade. Add the @sugar{1.5%cup} and pulse until the zest is very finely minced into the sugar.

Cream the room temperature @butter{0.25%lb} and beat in the sugar and lemon mixture. Add the @eggs{4}, 1 at a time, and then add the @lemon juice{1/2%cup} and @salt{0.125%tsp}. Mix until combined.

Pour the mixture into a #2 quart saucepan{} and cook over low heat until thickened (about ~{10%minutes}), stirring constantly. The lemon curd will thicken at about 170Â°F, or just below simmer. Remove from the heat and cool or refrigerate.
