Set a #large sieve{} over a #deep bowl{}. Dampen 2 layers of #cheesecloth{} with water and line the sieve with the cheesecloth.

Pour the @whole milk{4%cup} and @heavy cream{2%cup} into a #stainless-steel or enameled pot{} such as Le Creuset. Stir in the @salt{1%tsp}. Bring to a full boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and stir in the @white wine vinegar{3%Tbsp}. Allow the mixture to stand for ~{1%minute} until it curdles. It will separate into thick parts (the curds) and milky parts (the whey).

Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl at room temperature for 20 to ~{25%minutes}, occasionally discarding the liquid that collects in the bowl. The longer you let the mixture drain, the thicker the ricotta. (I tend to like mine on the thicker side, but some prefer it moister.) Transfer the ricotta to a #bowl{}, discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining whey. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The ricotta will keep refrigerated for 4 to 5 days.
