This classic Italian meringue does not require baking, because the egg whites are already cooked by the hot syrup. You may want to brown it lightly in a 350° oven. This meringue is not so stiff as Swiss or French.

Heat in a heavy pan and stir until dissolved 1/2 cup @water{1/2%cup}, 1/4 teaspoon @cream of tartar{1/4%tsp}, and 1 cup @sugar{1%cup}.

When the syrup is boiling cover and cook about ~{3%minutes} or until the steam has washed down any crystals that may have formed on the sides of the pan. Uncover and cook without stirring to 238° to 240°. Pour the syrup very gradually onto 3 well-beaten @egg whites{3} beating constantly, until this frosting meringue is cool and ready to be spread on the pie filling or pudding.
