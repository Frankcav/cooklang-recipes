Put @all-purpose flour{265%g} and @strong white bread flour{55%g} into a #bowl{}. Add the cubed @unsalted butter{55%g} and rub in with your fingertips.

Heat the @vegetable shortening{65%g} in a #pan{} until melted. Dissolve the @salt{1%tsp} in the @boiling water{135%ml}, then add to the melted lard.

Pour this liquid into the flour. Mix with a #spoon{} then, as soon as it is cool enough, tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and work together into a ball. Be careful that the dough is not too hot when you start to work it.

Once the dough ball is formed, leave it to cool slightly. If itâ€™s still lumpy, work it a minute or two longer.

Divide the dough in two, making one piece slightly bigger than the other.
