Pectin is a natural fiber found in most plants. Fruits like apples and oranges are particularly high in pectin, with the highest concentrations in the skins, cores and seeds.

In a #saucepan{}, boil two pounds of @tart green apples{2%lbs} (slightly under-ripe apples work best) with four cups of @water{4%cups} and one tablespoon of @lemon juice{1%Tbsp} for ~{30%minutes}, then strain through #cheesecloth{}

Boil further to reduce the volume by half will result in an effective homemade liquid pectin.
