Add @raw cashew{3/4%cup} pieces, @nutritional yeast{3%Tbsp}, @sea salt{3/4%tsp}, @garlic powder{1%dash}, and @onion powder (optional){1%dash} to a #food processor{}. Pulse to a fine meal, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Set aside. (This recipe will yield enough "cheese" to sprinkle on salads, pasta dishes, omelettes...store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge and it will keep for a couple of weeks.)
