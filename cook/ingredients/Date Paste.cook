Bring 4 cups of @water{4%cups} to a simmer and remove the #pot{} from the heat.

Place @Medjool dates{12%oz} into a #4 cup glass measuring cup{} and cover with hot water. Let dates sit for ~{10%minutes} to soften. Reserve 1.5 cups of the soaking liquid and drain the remaining water from the dates.

Place the dates and 1 cup of the reserved water into a #high speed blender{} and blend until smooth. Add more water if you'd like a thinner consistency. Transfer to a glass container and cover.
