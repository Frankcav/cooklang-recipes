Bring @ultra-pasteurized whole, 2 percent low-fat, 1 percent low-fat, or skim milk{7.5%cups} to 115°F in #saucepan{} over medium heat, 2 to ~{5%minutes}. (If your milk gets hotter than 115°F, let it cool to 115°F before proceeding. Higher temperatures can kill some cultures.) Off heat, whisk @plain yogurt{1/2%cup} into milk until very well combined. Divide mixture evenly between two #1-quart Mason jars{} (they will be very full; a funnel can be helpful for this step). Add lids, then screw on rings until just finger-tight.

Adjust oven rack to lowest position and turn on oven light. Bring 5 quarts @water{5%quarts} to boil in large covered pot. Place jars in second large pot. Add water until jars are submerged to their necks. (If jars are taller than pot, add water to 14 inches from rim of pot.) Remove jars and bring water to 120°F over medium heat. Return jars to pot of 120°F water. Transfer both pots to oven. Incubate yogurt, without opening oven door, for ~{5%hours}.

Remove 1 jar from water bath. Using #clean spoon{}, taste yogurt for tartness and consistency. If tarter, thicker yogurt is desired, return jar to water bath and shut oven door. (Bear in mind that yogurt will thicken significantly as it cools but can be loosened up by stirring prior to serving.) Set oven to 350°F and heat for ~{3%minutes} (start your timer as soon as you set the dial; oven will not reach 350°F). Turn off oven and let incubate for up to 10 more hours, repeating heating step each time oven door is opened. Remove jars from water bath and refrigerate until fully cooled and set, about ~{8%hours}. (Yogurt can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)
