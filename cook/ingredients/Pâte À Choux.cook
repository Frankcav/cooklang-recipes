Preheat the oven to 425°F.

Put the @water or milk{1%cup}, @unsalted butter{8%Tbsp}, and @salt{3/8%tsp} and @sugar (optional){2%tsp} in a #saucepan{} and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Remove it from the heat and add the @flour{1.25%cups} all at once. Stir vigorously. Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat, stirring all the while, until the mixture forms a ball; this should take only about a minute. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool for 5 to ~{10%minutes}, to 140°F. It will still feel hot, but you should be able to hold a finger in it for a few seconds. Transfer the dough to a mixer and beat in the room temperature @eggs{4%large} one at a time; the mixture will become fluffy. Beat for at least ~{2%minutes} after adding the last egg.

Form the choux paste into whatever shape you desire, using a #spoon{}, or by putting the dough in a pastry bag and piping it.

Bake for ~{15%minutes}, then reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and bake for an additional ~{15%minutes}. Turn off the oven, open the door a crack, and leave the pastry inside to cool for ~{30%minutes}. Remove from the oven to cool completely. Carefully split the pastry, fill, and frost as desired.
