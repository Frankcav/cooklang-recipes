You can use raw or preroasted peanuts here, but do not use salted peanuts. Roasting the nuts before grinding them not only boosts their flavor but also warms their oils, allowing for faster breakdown during processing. (We also warm preroasted nuts for this reason.) You can customize your peanut butter by adding 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger or 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the peanuts before processing in step 2.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375Â°F. Spread @raw or preroasted peanuts{4%cups} in single layer on #rimmed baking sheet{} and roast until fragrant and slightly darkened, 10 to ~{12%minutes}, rotating sheet halfway through roasting. (If using preroasted peanuts, place in oven for 5 minutes to warm.) Transfer sheet to wire rack and let peanuts cool slightly, about ~{10%minutes}.
