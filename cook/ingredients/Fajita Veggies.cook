In a #large skillet{} over medium-high heat, heat @sunflower oil{1/4%cup} until shimmering. Add @green peppers{2%large}, @red onions{1%large}, @oregano{1/2%tsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp} to taste (I like 1/2 teaspoon).

Cook, tossing occasionally, until slightly softened but still tender-crisp, about ~{7%minutes}. Remove from heat and serve.
