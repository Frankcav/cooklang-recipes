Put the @almonds{} in a #heat-safe bowl{} and pour @boiling water{} on top to cover. Let stand for ~{1%minutes} (don't let them soak too long in the hot water or the nuts themselves will soften too much).

Drain the almonds and run cold water over them to cool them down.

The soaked almonds should now have skins that are loose enough to remove. Working one almond at a time, gently squeeze the nut between your fingers to begin popping it out of the skin, then peel the skin away to remove it fully.
